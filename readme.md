# Fart Machine

This repository contains a simple Python script for synthesizing fart sounds entirely in code. The sound is built from low-frequency oscillators, dynamic filtering, and waveshaping to create a short, expressive burst.

## Usage

```
python fart_machine.py [output.wav]
```

Running the script writes a WAV file (default `fart.wav`) with a generated fart noise.
