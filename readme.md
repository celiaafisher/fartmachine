This repository contains a simple example of generating a sawtooth wave in Python.

The `saw_wave.py` script plays a low-pitched sawtooth wave using `numpy` and `sounddevice`.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Running the script plays a random sawtooth tone between **30 Hz** and **45 Hz** for 2 seconds. Each run will generate a different frequency. Run:

```bash
python saw_wave.py
```
