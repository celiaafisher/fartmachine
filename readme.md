This repository contains a simple example of a low-frequency sawtooth oscillator.

Run `lowfreq_saw.py` to generate a 3 Hz sawtooth wave at 44.1kHz. Press Enter when prompted and a WAV file named `lfo_saw.wav` will be created in the same directory. If the `simpleaudio` package is installed, the sound will also play automatically.
